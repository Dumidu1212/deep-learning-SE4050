Task 2

 Q1)
     - With very few nodes, the network underfits (Lower accuracy).
     - When increase nodes moderately, the model captures more complex patterns (Accuracy improves).
     
 Q2)
     - It follows the bias variance tradeoff,
 	- Too small (high bias - underfitting)
	- Moderate (best generalization)
	- Too large (high variance - overfitting)
